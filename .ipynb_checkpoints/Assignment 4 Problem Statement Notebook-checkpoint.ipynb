    "# Write a program to go through 1000 random integers and check whether they are even or prime. In order to create a list of 1000 random integers, you can write the following statement: \n",
    "\n",
    "# import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# random_integers = np.random.randint(low=0, high=2000, size=(1000,))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now pass the list of these 1000 random integers to a user defined function called even_prime_list_creation. This function will accept a list of 1000 random integers and return two lists of even as well as prime numbers. Make sure that your function does this in a recursive manner (remember that you can't use loop to go through each number in a list of 1000 random integers, that has to be done in a recursive manner)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now, in order to create a list of even as well as prime numbers, even_prime_list_creation should know that which number is an even number and which number is a prime number. Well even number is easy to check so your function even_prime_list_creation can itself check whether the number is even or not but in order to check whether the number is prime or not, even_prime_list_creation is going to call another function called is_prime. This, is_prime function will accept a number and check whether it's prime or not in a recursive manner (again you can't use a loop to check whether the number is prime or not, that has to be done in a recursive manner) and is going to return True or False accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "# So, both functions should do their job in a recursive manner. And the final outcome should be two lists, one of even number and one of prime numbers. "
